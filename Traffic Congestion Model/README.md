This project provides a machine learning-based solution for classifying real-time traffic congestion. The system fetches currentSpeed and freeFlowSpeed data from various locations using the TomTom API. This data is then labeled as 'High', 'Medium', or 'Low' congestion based on the ratio between the current and free-flow speeds. A Decision Tree Classifier is trained on this collected data, using currentSpeed and freeFlowSpeed as predictive features. The model was trained and evaluated, achieving an accuracy of 78% on the test set, and then saved as classifier.pkl. A separate script loads this saved model, takes latitude and longitude as user input, retrieves the live traffic data for that point via the get_traffic_data function, and predicts the current congestion level.
