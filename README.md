This project involved developing a predictive ML model for Apple's stock-price. I conducted feature engineering by analyzing a correlation matrix to select influential economic indicators like GDP and CPI. A Random Forest Regression model was built for the prediction of multiple target variables (Open and Close prices). The model's performance was validated through comprehensive evaluation, achieving a high RÂ² score of 0.97.
