Stock Price Preiction Model - This project involved developing a predictive ML model for Apple's stock-price. I conducted feature engineering by analyzing a correlation matrix to select influential economic indicators like GDP and CPI. A Random Forest Regression model was built for the prediction of multiple target variables (Open and Close prices). The model's performance was validated through comprehensive evaluation, achieving a high RÂ² score of 0.97.


Salary Prediction Model - This project involved developing a salary prediction structure based on two numerical inputs: age, education level and experience. Use one-to-one mapping for education level. Used pair plotd and correlation to analyse the interdendability for the features. Employed gradient descent optimization to minimize the loss function and enhance model precision. Visualized the relationship and training progress on a graph for interpretability. Achieved a model accuracy of around 0.89, demonstrating robust predictive capability.
